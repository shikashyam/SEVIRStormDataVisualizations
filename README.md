# SEVIRStormDataVisualizations

The SEVIR Dataset is a Storm Event Imagery Dataset for Deep Learning Applications in Radar and Satellite Meteorology. With advances in computing technology it has become more easy than ever to work with deep learning and machine learning frameworks in data intensive domains such as meteorology, specifically in focus areas such as nowcasting, synthetic radar generation, front detection among others which deal with petabytes of data. The SEVIR is a single source rich dataset that contains spatially and temporally aligned data generated by multiple sensors.
It contains images of 384km x 384km stretches sampled over US soil and consists of 4 hours of data in 5 minute intervals.

We look at SEVIR data on a holistic level by bringing the data catalog, Storm Details, Storm Fatalities and Storm locations files for the year 2019 onto Google Data Studio. We will be making use of Google Data Studio to create interactive and informative dashboards based on the results of our preliminary analysis on BigQuery.

The link to the actual dashboard is - https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/4509fa74-dec5-4e4e-a370-39d8ffb56571.
Additionally, there is a PDF version here in this repo for easy access.
